Fade in: INT. OFFICE. DAYFakra is on the phone at the front desk. La Hor walks by.Fakra expectantly jumps up.FAKRA: Hi La Hor pays no attention as she walks by. CORPORAL comes at the front desk. He points his iphone to Fakra.CORPORAL: Have you played Wordament? This game is so addictive.FAKRA:No. What is about?CORPORAL: Give me your phone. All you gotta do is make as many words in 2 minutes from the given letters. And the best part, everyone gets to play the exact same game at any point in timeCORPORAL fiddles with phone and then lets Fakra see as he punches lettersFAKRA: English is not my first language. I have to translate my speech in 5 Indian languages before I come up with words in English.CORPORAL: C’mon! Watch and learn from the master! And, this is one game, I’ll let you play at work. Alright, here it starts. May the best man win!Both play on their phones. A buzzer goes off.CORPORAL: I got 525 points. How about you?FAKRA: It says 800.CORPORAL: snatches Fakra’s phone.CORPORAL:Good, beginner’s luck! Let’s play another one. Get ready to be vanquished.Fakra and CORPORAL fiddle with their phones.     
CORPORAL: Ha! 900. FAKRA: 1200An annoyed CORPORAL snatches Fakra’s phone.                    FAKRA:Thanks for teaching me. Oh! Look the next game is starting.CORPORAL: Get back to work, I don’t pay you to play games.FAKRA: Ok. Do you want me to post our scores on Facebook?CORPORAL:I will send you a memo when I am ready to post my scores. Now, get back to work.CORPORAL leaves. Fakra shrugs and gets back to his desk, as La Hor walks by. Fakra waves but La Hor does not see him and entersBLACKISH WIDOW’s office:BLACKISH WIDOW is sipping whiskey.                    
LA HOR: You wanted to see me?BLACKISH WIDOW:Sulk is coming. He wants to meet you LA HOR: Why?BLACKISH WIDOW: If I were you, I’d start packing. Performance issues.Fakra, standing outside the office is listening to the conversation. He indignantly walks in.     FAKRA:How could you?LA HOR: I got this.FAKRA:No, no! Leave it to me. I know how to handle her.Fakra steps closer to CORPORAL.  La Hor shakes her head as she walks out, Fakra does not see her go.                    
BLACKISH WIDOW:Handle me darling, man handle me!BLACKISH WIDOW grabs Fakra and kisses him.                    FAKRA:Ew! Get away from me and get some help! BLACKISH WIDOW:But my gyno said I’m fine. He’s very thoroughFAKRA: For your brain!BLACKISH WIDOW: Yes, and he says that the after check up sex keeps my brain healthy...do you like to play doctor? I am ready for a check up.Fakra squirms and walks out. BLACKISH WIDOW smiles and blows him a kissas he leaves. Cut to - front desk. Fakra gets up and walks towards the conference room. Sulk enters the office.                    
FAKRA:Hello, can I help you?SULK:(surprised)Ahhh! Stranger Danger!Sulk, panic-stricken, slams his hand onto Fakra’s face and pushes his head against the wall. Fakra tries to wriggle out, but can’t.                    
SULK:Who are you? Sulk never seen youhere before. Where’s Karl?FAKRA:Karl quit, sort of...I am Fakra.You must be Sulk.                    
SULK:Yes, Sulk is Sulk. Sulk not hear about new Karl.Sulk stares at lipstick on Fakra’s face and recognizes it to be BLACKISH WIDOW’s. Fakra becomes conscious of Sulk’s gaze.     
SULK:Oh! Sulk sees where you came from. New Karl has a special lady in his life.
FAKRA’S MOM (OC) Hain! he knows about me? HELLO!...can you hear me?... Who’s this buffalo?Fakra manages to free himself.FAKRA:(rambles)No, no, no there is no one!SULK:Listen to HER. She knows what she talks about. Don’t angry HER.Sulk walks away. Fakra is stunned.FAKRA’S MOM (OC:)Oh My God!...Buffalo Genius!Cut to - Corporal’s office:Corporal lines up candles on his desk and them lights them up. He takes couple of deep breadths and then fishes out his phone to play Wordament. Sulk walks in. CORPORAL briefly looks upat Sulk and then gets back at his game.                    
SULK:Corporal, Sulk says it’s time! Do you have it? Without taking his eyes off the phone, CORPORAL pulls out a box and puts in on the table. CORPORAL looks out of the window and then throws his phone on the table. He looks at Sulk, who isgoing through the box.                    
CORPORAL: Are you sure about her?CORPORAL looks around, then picks up a book and starts reading.SULK: Sulk does not question Dick’s authority? Dick Fury promoted Sulk.Sulk not lose loyalty.CORPORAL:Just your sanity.SULK:(under his breadth)Sanity is but another form of madness.CORPORAL:What did you say?SULK:Dick says that she is ready. No challenge Dick.CORPORAL:But still, what do you think?SULK: Sulk says, La Hor has breast chance for success, Sulk said BEST chance for success. BEST!...What are you reading?CORPORAL: How to escape from bullshitSULK: STILL?! You reading same book every time Sulk visits. And you still not finished?CORPORAL: What can I say, you inspire me to catch up on my reading. One day,I’ll have mastered and know exactly what to do every time you come here.Sulk looks out of the window.                    
SULK: Hmm... CORPORAL: What is it? SULK:New Karl...he is strange.CORPORAL: (Sharply) Isn’t he?...too smart for his owngood.

Let’s just get this over and done with so Sulk can go back to Happy Hour...by himself...again.CORPORAL picks up the phone.
CORPORAL: Hey, Sulk is here to see you...yes come to the conference room.CORPORAL hangs up. Sulk walks outCut to - The Conference Room:Fakra walks by the conference room and sees La Hor HOB Sulk. He freezes for a moment, but then back paddles slowly and walks inside. Sulk hands over the box to a delighted La Hor.                    
FAKRA:Hey! What’s the occasion? Did someone just get engaged?LA HOR: Better, I got promoted.FAKRA: Yes! much better, indeed! That calls for a celebration! Drinks on me tonight, and you can’t say no!SULK: Don’t forget to bring your special lady. Sulk is sure she’d want to comeLA HOR: Oh! Looks like someone has been keeping a secret. Who’s this lucky woman?FAKRA’S MOM (OC): Go on tell them! Behind my successful son, is his mother.FAKRA: Naw, there is no one. What are you saying? FAKRA’S MOM (OC: Besharam, learn from this buffalo God! BLACKISH WIDOW enters the conference room and heads straight for Sulk. She brushes Fakra shoulder.                    
BLACKISH WIDOW: Sunshine! when did you show up? Now I know why this office feels so happy and warm.  I missed you so much. C’mon baby, give me a hug.SULK: (nervously) Um...Hello! BLACKISH WIDOW Laughs and tightly hugs a noncommittal Sulk. She then takes his hand  and pulls him away from La Hor.                    
BLACKISH WIDOW: I know why you are here, let’s get it out of the way. Then we can goto my place...SULK:Actually, you can help Sulk. Can you get everyone in this room?BLACKISH WIDOW acts surprised, and lets out nervous laugh. Then turns around and barks at Fakra.BLACKISH WIDOW: Well, You heard the man, what are you waiting for?Fakra stomps out. BLACKISH WIDOW suspiciously eyes a smiling La Hor. Fakra returns with Corporal and Long. Sulk moves in thecenter to address the room.                    
SULK:Guardians, Sulk has traveled across the world to be here today for a special reason. Sulk has bad news and good newsCORPORAL starts fidgeting, he looks around and then discreetly pulls out his cell phone. He gestures to Fakra to take out his cell phone. Fakra shakes his head in refusal. Sulk pullsout a stack of flash cards from his pocket.                    

SULK:Bad news. Humanity is in grave danger. The Assguards are training dogs to fight the human race.CORPORAL arches his brows and gestures more forcefully. Fakra caves in and reluctantly digs out his cell phone. CORPORAL times out with his fingers 3, 2, 1 and then taps his finger inair.                    

SULK:Good news. Humanity needs new leaders who can inspire, lead and take the battle back to the enemy.There is one such leader amongst us right here, and the time has come to recognize the heroics and valor.CORPORAL is focused on playing wordament on his phone. Fakra joins the game but is distracted and intermittently looks up at Sulk and La Hor. BLACKISH WIDOW starts smiling and adjusts herdress. Long expectantly leans in.                    

SULK:I am delighted to acknowledge La Hor’s contribution to Marvel R Us.Wordament’s buzzer goes off! CORPORAL looks up at Fakra.                    
SULK:She has been a beacon of light and warmth (slightly drifting in thought while staring at La Hor’s breasts)in these dark, cold nights...uhh, times! Sulk meant dark, cold times.CORPORAL gestures 5,5, 4 to Fakra. Fakra gestures 5,5,3.    	   
SULK: And so, by orders from Dick Fury,La Hor is now officially, the next in line -CORPORAL leaps up in excitement, cries out Yes! Fakra and BLACKISH WIDOW together cry out No! BLACKISH WIDOW feigns to faint. Fakragrabs her to stop her from falling. BLACKISH WIDOW holds on to him tightly. LA HOR looks at Fakra with suspicion.                    
FAKRA:Are you Ok?BLACKISH WIDOW:Weak, but baby, hold me tight...better...tighter. Yeah,that will make me happy.SULK: Sulk glad lady happy for La Hor -LONG:She gets a gift and a promotion. What about me?LA HOR: Thanks for recognizing my talent and hard work. I assure you that I will foil the Assguardian plans. I will train the cats to take on the dogs of this world and will not rest till every cat becomes a sentinel. In this quest, I will need every help that I can get, especially from all of you.FAKRA: Just say the word.SULK: Sure, go on, what do you need?CORPORAL dismissively waves.                    
LA HOR: I would like a partner to help me in this new missionSULK: Sulk wish he could be your partner.LA HOR: Aw! Thank you! Best day ever!La Hor smiles, opens her arms to HOB Sulk. Fakra pushes BLACKISH WIDOW, who almost falls to the ground. Fakra grabs the box and shoves it in La Hor’s hands to prevent her from HOB’ing Sulk.FAKRA: Well, what’s in the box? All of us are eager to see your gift.La Hor smiles, opens the box to reveal a soft toy hammer. She is delighted.                    
SULK: This is a training hammer, it help you get stronger.LA HOR:Oh! The best gift ever! My own hammer! La Hor throws the hammer an open space in the room. The hammer lands inches from La Hor. CORPORAL glares at Sulk                    BLACKISH WIDOW:Oh my! La Hor is throwing up. Someone get a bucket.FAKRA:WoW! That’s a powerful throw. I will be honored to be your partner in your new missionLA HOR:Thanks! But, I want to go with experience...someone trustworthy, who felt happy with my promotion, someone who can help me quickly navigate the Marvel R Us universe to find the best cat trainer.Fakra looks dejected. Smiling BLACKISH WIDOW moves her arm around him to comfort him.                    
LA HOR: Long, I would like you to be my partner -Long is beaming with happiness.LONG:Finally!!! The moment I had been waiting for all these years...my skills, talent, and expertise uniquely position me to -LA HOR: Yes, yes and for all that, I am appointing you as my assistant. Congratulations on your promotion. Now, go get methat hammer.Long’s mouth opens wide and he just stands still.                    
LONG:What? Your assistant!Long staggers, barely able to keep standing. His mouth is wide open.                    
CORPORAL:Never seen anyone be so stunned with delight.                    
SULK:Go on, Long, fetch the hammer! It good exercise.Long struggles to keep his cool. He is shaking with anger, he moves slowly, picks up the hammer and hands it to La Hor and walks away.                    
LA HOR:This time, I will make it come backLa Hor throws the hammer. She pulls her hand back to make the hammer come back to her. The hammer hits Long’s bluetooth headset. Long slumps in a chair.                    
LONG:Your gift keeps on givingSULK:Look at the time. Sulk has another meeting at the bar. Um...far. Another meeting that is far. SULK: Sulk work here is done!CORPORAL:You have spread enough pixie dust for one day. LONG:More like juggernaut, destroying everything that came in his way.SULK:Isn’t he funny?La Hor, Sulk, CORPORAL laugh. BLACKISH WIDOW laughs the loudest. Fakra manages a wry smile. Long switches between laughing and crying.      
CORPORAL:(Handing Fakra his cellphone) Fakra, I am now ready for Facebook.Fade out:
